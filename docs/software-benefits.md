# **Address Book Software Documentation**

### Aims and benefits of this software
This software is being made at the request of the client, DF Corp, to allow users to organize
and maintain their contact details in an independent application.

There will likely be two principle users of the software:
* **Personal Users** - these are individuals who are using the program to store the contact details 
of their family & friends so that they can stay in touch with them.
* **Corporate Users** - these are people who will be issued the software by their employer as a 
means of storing the contact details of colleagues, clients, prospective opportunities etc.

The functionality for both of these types of users will be the same: users will be able to add, remove,
edit, and search for their contacts within the application by interacting with a console.

The main benefits of the software to the users include:
* **All contacts in one place** - users will be able to store all of their contacts in one place, which
is an easy-to-use application they can interact with, rather than having contact details stored across
different mediums, on devices and written on paper for example. This means the users will always know
where to go for any relevant contact details they need.
* **Access from anywhere** - users will always be able to access the application no matter what device
they are using, reducing the risk of e.g. being away from your desk, where the one phone number you are
looking for is written on a sticky note.
* **Editable** - users will be able to change the details stored for their contacts as they wish, meaning
that if they change phone number or email address, there is no remaining record of the old details
which could be confusing to the user if they aren't sure which is the most recent.

Introducing this address book product into the range of products that DF Corp have available will
undoubtedly attract more customers to the services the company can offer. Not only will customers be 
very engaged with the address book product itself, they will also become exposed to the other products
(such as the secret diary) and choose to make use of those products too where applicable.
